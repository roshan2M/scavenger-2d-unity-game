# scavenger-2d-unity-game

This is a 2D turn-based tile game made using Unity. It was made using a tutorial by Unity. In the game, the main character has a food score. Every time the character moves or interacts with enemies or walls, he loses a certain amount of food points. He can also collect soda and food on the way to help him survive longer. If he reaches a food score of 0, he essentially starves and the game is over.

There are several parts to this game - the prefabs, the scripts, the animations, etc. You can look through these in their respective folders. The main character, enemies, tiles, walls and food items are all modelled using prefabs. Their interactions are controlled via script in C#.
